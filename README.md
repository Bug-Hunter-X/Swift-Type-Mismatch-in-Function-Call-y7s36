# Swift Type Mismatch Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: a type mismatch when calling a function. The `calculateArea` function expects `Double` arguments, but the second call attempts to pass a `String`. This results in a compile-time error. The solution shows how to correctly handle this by ensuring the correct data types are used when calling the function.
